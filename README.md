# Trunfo

What is Trunfo?

Trunfo is a personal asset manager that tracks what assets you have. Assets can be organized by properties and rooms within properties. You can store information such as description, purchased date, warranty information, material composition, value and even attach pictures and documents on each asset. 

The story behind Trunfo

I was watching the news following Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael and when I saw the flooding people had to deal with, the one thing that kept popping into my mind was: "How much of a hassle it would be to deal with the insurance after a flood". Then I thought of all the paperwork you would have to file and all the affected items you would have to list and then provide proof of purchase etc. I suddenly realized that all of that was in a box somewhere in my walk-in closet. But in the event of a flood, this box would be floating along with all the other items. This is when I got the idea to build a web app that would store all that information online so I could quickly search it and get access to it in the event of a disaster or burglary. 

The App was written with Ruby on Rails 6 with a Postgres database and file storage using AWS S3
